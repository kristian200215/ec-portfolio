          I am an IT Graduate and a CSC professional licensure passer with over
          2 years of coding experience. Throughout this time, Iâ€™ve developed
          various systems for our local LGU, gaining hands-on experience in
          building functional and user-friendly applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to professional projects, I have also worked on personal
          coding projects that allowed me to explore new technologies and expand
          my skill set. I enjoy solving problems through programming and
          creating systems that make processes easier and more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of coding, I have a passion for cooking and exploring the IT
          world. I also love designing creative visuals, including posters,
          videos, and photo edits, combining both technical and artistic skills
          in my work.
